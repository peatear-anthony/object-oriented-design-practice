# Object Oriented Design Practice in Python


### About
Collection of some OO-design problems solved in Python.

All questions were solved under a timed environment; therefore, quality and accuracy cannot be guaranteed.
In addition, most of the code is written under the context of an OO-design interview. As such, most of the code will not be executable.

### Format
The general format of each question/solution will be requirements -> Use Case Diagram -> Class Diagram -> code.
